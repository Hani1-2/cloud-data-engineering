-- Q1: List all brand names from the brands table.
SELECT brand_name 
FROM production.brands;

-- Q2: Show the product name and list price of all products,
-- sorted from most expensive to cheapest.
SELECT product_name, list_price 
FROM production.products
ORDER BY list_price DESC;

-- Q3: Find all customers who live in the state of New York (NY).
SELECT * FROM sales.customers
WHERE state = 'NY';

-- Q4: Show only the top 5 most expensive products in the store.
-- For SQL Server
SELECT TOP 5 product_name, list_price 
FROM production.products
ORDER BY list_price DESC;

-- Q5: List all products with a price between $200 and $500,
-- sorted by price ascending.
SELECT * FROM production.products
WHERE list_price BETWEEN 200 AND 500
ORDER BY list_price ASC;

-- Q6: Find all customers whose last name starts with the letter 'S'.
SELECT * FROM sales.customers
WHERE last_name LIKE 'S%';

-- Q7: List all products that belong to:
-- category 6 (Mountain Bikes) OR category 7 (Road Bikes).
SELECT * FROM production.products
WHERE category_id IN (6, 7);
 Alternative: WHERE category_id = 6 OR category_id = 7;

-- Q8: Show all orders that have NOT been shipped yet
-- (shipped_date is missing).
SELECT * FROM sales.orders
WHERE shipped_date IS NULL;

-- Q9: Display:
-- product name,
-- brand ID,
-- and a computed column showing 15% off the list price
-- labeled as 'Sale Price'.
SELECT product_name, brand_id, (list_price * 0.85) AS [Sale Price]
FROM production.products;

-- Q10: Get a unique list of all cities where BikeStores customers live,
-- sorted alphabetically.
SELECT DISTINCT city 
FROM sales.customers
ORDER BY city ASC;

-- Q11: List all staff members who are currently active (active = 1),
-- showing their full name and email.
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name, email 
FROM sales.staffs
WHERE active = 1;

-- Q12: Using UNION:
-- Get a combined list of all cities from both customers and stores
-- (no duplicates), sorted A–Z.
SELECT city FROM sales.customers
UNION
SELECT city FROM sales.stores
ORDER BY city ASC;

-- Q13: Using EXCEPT:
-- Find product IDs that exist in order_items
-- but are NOT in the products table.
SELECT product_id FROM sales.order_items
EXCEPT
SELECT product_id FROM production.products;

-- Q14: List all products from the year 2016
-- with a price greater than $1,500,
-- sorted by price descending.
SELECT * FROM production.products
WHERE model_year = 2016 AND list_price > 1500
ORDER BY list_price DESC;

-- Q15 (BONUS): Using UNION ALL:
-- Show Trek (brand_id = 9) products from 2016
-- and Surly (brand_id = 8) products from 2017.
-- Include product name, brand, year, and price.
-- Order by year then price descending.
SELECT product_name, brand_id, model_year, list_price
FROM production.products
WHERE brand_id = 9 AND model_year = 2016

UNION ALL

SELECT product_name, brand_id, model_year, list_price
FROM production.products
WHERE brand_id = 8 AND model_year = 2017

ORDER BY model_year ASC, list_price DESC;
